# fake-os

Welcome to my fake OS, which has been made in the style of Windows XP! 

This nostalgic OS brings back memories of an embarassing amount of hours spent playing The Sims 2, while listening to the visually-hypnotic music displayed on Windows Media Player.

This project was built using HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript. As this was my first time using JavaScript, my main challenge was toggling the open/close of the modals and the start menu.
